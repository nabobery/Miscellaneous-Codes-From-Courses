                <h2 id="heading">Here's a timeline of Alan Turing's life :</h2>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>1912</strong> <br/>
                    Born on June 23 in Maida Vale, London
                </li>
                <li><strong>1918</strong> <br/>
                    Turing joins St Michael’s day school in Hastings, where he does not do very well. 
                </li>
                <li><strong>1922</strong> <br/>
                    Turing is sent to Hazelhurst Preparatory School where he does much better and learns to play chess.
                </li>
                <li><strong>1926 - 1931</strong> <br/>
                    He went on to Sherborne School, a well-known independent school in the market town of Sherborne in Dorset.
                </li>
                <li><strong>1931 - 1934</strong> <br/>
                    Enters King’s College, Cambridge, as mathematics scholar. He gained first-class honours in Mathematics.
                </li>
                <li><strong>1935</strong> <br/>
                    Turing was motivated by Gödel’s work to seek an algorithmic method of determining whether any given propositions were undecidable, with the ultimate goal of eliminating them from mathematics. 
                </li>
                <li><strong>1936</strong> <br/>
                    He Submitted a paper titled  "<b><i> On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem (decision problem)</b></i> " in which he outlines the Universal Machine, which later became known as the Turing Machine.
                </li>
                <li><strong>1936 - 1938</strong> <br/> 
                    In September Turing went to the Institute of Advanced Studies at Princeton, studying under Alonzo Church. There he started to study cryptology as well as mathematics. 
                </li>
                <li><strong>1938</strong> <br/> 
                    He obtained his PhD from Princeton University; his Ph.D. thesis under the direction of the American mathematician Alonzo Church introduced the concept of ordinal logic and the notion of relative computing allowing a study of problems that cannot be solved by a Turing machine. 
                </li>
                <li><strong>1939</strong> <br/> 
                    Turing is asked to join the Government Codes and Ciphers School and arrives at Bletchley Park the day after war is declared. There he works with Gordon Welchman to develop the Bombe, a device for decrypting the messages sent by Germans using their Enigma machines. Conceptualises programmable computer, the first such machine is built 3 years later, based on his ideas. These machines were the predecessors to the first digital computers. 
                </li>
                <li><strong>1943</strong> <br/> 
                    Turing is asked to work as a top level intelligence link with USA, which he visits to share information on cryptology. Works at Bell Laboratories on speech encypherment. 
                </li>
                <li><strong>1944</strong> <br/> 
                    Turing was awarded the OBE for his wartime services, but his work remained secret for many years.
                </li>
                <li><strong>1947</strong> <br/> 
                    He returned to Cambridge for a sabbatical year during which he produced a seminal work on Intelligent Machinery that was not published in his lifetime. 
                </li>
                <li><strong>1950</strong> <br/> 
                    Publishes Computing Machinery and Intelligence, introducing a test of intelligence, that he said would prove a machine could think. This test later became known as the Turing Test. 
                </li>
                <li><strong>1951</strong> <br/> 
                    Turing is elected Fellow of the Royal Society FRS and also gives a talk about Artificial Intelligence on the BBC radio’s Third Programme.
                </li>
                <li><strong>1952 - 1954</strong> <br/> 
                    Turing publishes his classic paper on computer chess. Turing worked from 1952 until his death in 1954 on mathematical biology, specifically morphogenesis. 
                </li>
                <li><strong>1954</strong> <br/> 
                    Dies of cyanide poisoning June 7 in Wilmslow, Cheshire, England. June 8th – Turing’s body is found in his home in Wilmslow, Cheshire.
                </li>
